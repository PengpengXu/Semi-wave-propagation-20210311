This article analyzes the non-linear wave propagation in the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model of a very large floating structure. The multi-time-scale perturbation method with the introduction of the wave steepness as the perturbation leads to hierarchic equations. Up to the moderate-high range, the solution shows that the plane progressive wave remains its linear property and is corrected by the non-linearity, showing amplitudes dispersion in term of the second-order.
