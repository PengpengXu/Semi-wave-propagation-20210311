\cite{Ma2020} gives two-dimensional (2D) analytical solution to the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model of very large floating structures (VLFS), in which the non-linear water wave is coupled with the linear Euler-Bernoulli beam. 

\cite{Jang2013} introduces a new integral approach to solve the non-linear Euler-Bernoulli-von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n beam.

\cite{Vanden-Broeck2011} derives the non-linear waves travelling in infinitely long floating ice floes with an adopted Stokes expansion. The non-linearity is due to the ice non-linear stiffness that involves non-linear calculation of curvature and also the non-linear water potential. The structural dynamic is neglected. 

\cite{D.Wang2002} gives the solution of linear FSI waves in floating plates in both infinite and finite domains. The finite domain problem is numerically solved by the boundary element method.

Our hypothesises are i). the geometrical non-linearity is a small term in terms of wave amplitude and ii). it corrects the dispersion relation. With the first hypothesis, the wave propagation shall maintain the major linear properties. With the second hypothesis, the non-linearity shall correct the wave propagation with the scale of wave amplitude.
